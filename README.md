## Business Introduction

As customer demand grows and menu offerings expand, leadership requires data-driven insights to better understand purchasing behavior, optimize operations, and improve profitability.

This project analyzes historical transaction-level data and presents insights through an interactive Excel dashboard. The goal is to translate raw sales data into actionable business intelligence that supports strategic decision-making across revenue performance, product optimization, and customer behavior.

## Problem Statement

Sweet Sensation Pizza faces several operational and strategic challenges:

- Limited clarity on **when demand is highest**, leading to inefficiencies in staffing and preparation.
- Uncertainty around **which products and sizes drive revenue and volume**.

1. **Revenue:** How is the business performing overall, and when does demand peak?
2. **Product:** Which categories, sizes, and pizzas perform best and worst?
